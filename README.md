# Build a web app that is integrated with Google Ads (this is the backend)

This project will teach you how to build a backend for your web app that integrates with Google Ads using Google Ads API. To see the project for the frontend, go [here](https://github.com/fblascogarma/google_ads_frontend)

I have [this repo](https://github.com/fblascogarma/backend_starter) to help you get started with a basic backend using Django, and [this repo](https://github.com/fblascogarma/frontend_starter) to help you get started with a basic frontend using React. We will build from these two repos.

If this project helped you, please give it a star, and if you have suggestions, they are more than welcome. Thank you!

# Assumptions & Prerequisites

1) You already have a Google account. If you haven’t, go [here](https://accounts.google.com/signin).

2) You already have a Google Ads Manager account. If you haven’t, go [here](https://ads.google.com/home/tools/manager-accounts/).

3) You already have a basic/standard developer token access. If you haven’t, go [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token). I have the basic access that gives me 15,000 operations / day (15k resources/day) and 1,000 requests / day, which is more than enough for this tutorial.

4) You already have a web app functioning where you can develop this Google Ads solution. If you haven't, use my [backend starter](https://github.com/fblascogarma/backend_starter) and my [frontend starter](https://github.com/fblascogarma/frontend_starter).

5) You know Python, JavaScript, full-stack web development, and APIs.

I’ll use Django (Python framework) for the backend, React (JavaScript framework/library) for the frontend, and Bootstrap for CSS.

Also, I will use environment variables for privacy concerns and ignore the client_secret.json file from my Google Cloud Platform project.

# Steps (WIP)

I will complete this later.
